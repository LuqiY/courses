\textbf{1.} How did the learning rate effect the convergence?\\

The convergence is evaluated by examining the log-likelihood function. The corresponding values for different eta values are shown below.

\textbf{2.} What was the stopping criteria and how many passes did it require?\\

The stopping criteria was set to be whenever the log-likelihood of the hold-out set stops increasing. \\

\textbf{3.} What words are the best predictors of each class?\\

The $5$ best predictors of the auto class are \texttt{car, cars, pocket, keys, warning}, since they have the lowest weights.\\

The $5$ best predictors of the motor class are \texttt{dod, bike, exhaust, bikes, ride} because they have the highest weights.\\

\textbf{4.} What words are the poorest predictors of classes?\\
The $5$ poorest predictors are \texttt{highest, heavily, horribly, gyroscoptic, medium} since they have the smallest weight in terms of absolute value.\\

\textbf{Extra Credit.} Use a schedule to update the learning rate\\

The schedule is implemented of the form $\eta_k=\frac{\eta_0}{1+\alpha k/n}$. The effect is shown below.
